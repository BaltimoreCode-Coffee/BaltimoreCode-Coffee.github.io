Code &amp; Coffee Summer Workshops
**Topic:** Communication Skills for Developers: Speak Up Outside of Stand Up!
**Presenter:** Barry Wright

&quot;The more you progress in your career as a software developer, the more critical communication skills become. Advocating for your work, clarifying requirements, and collaborating across teams are all crucial expectations, and they all need you to speak up!&quot;

In this workshop, Barry will show us the core pieces of effective communication and give you plenty of opportunities to practice initiating discussion, reflecting back what you’re hearing, and making key connections between people.

**SCHEDULE:**
10:00 AM: Begin
10:30 AM: Intro Circle
10:45 AM: Workshop Begins
1:00 PM: End
**PARKING:** There is metered street parking. If all else fails, park at the West Street Garage. Residents of Baltimore near Charles St should consider the free Charm City Circulator bus.
